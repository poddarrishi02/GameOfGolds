# GameOfGolds
Inside the Castle of Asymptopia there is a maze, and along each corridor of the maze there is a bag of gold coins. The amount of gold in each bag varies. A noble knight, named Sir Paul, will be given the opportunity to walk through the maze, picking up bags of gold. He may enter the maze only through a door marked ENTER and exit through another door marked EXIT. While in the maze, he may not retrace his steps. Each corridor of the maze has an arrow painted on the wall. Sir Paul may only go down the corridor in the direction of the arrow. There is no way to traverse a loop in the maze. Given a map of the maze, including the amount of gold in and the direction of each corridor, describe an algorithm to help Sir Paul pick up the most gold.
